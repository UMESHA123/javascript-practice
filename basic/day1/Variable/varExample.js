//var means variable
//= is the assignment operater
//the advantage is if i want to log some name or some message in the terminal or some 
// other perpose in that case i need to write that message multiple time 
// but if i stored in the some variable then i can simply log that variable to display the 
// message multiple time

console.log("gfg");
console.log("gfg");


//or 

var gfgVar  = "gfg";
console.log(gfgVar);
console.log(gfgVar);


//if update need the variable then updating the variable is also easy

var gfgVar = "hello gfg";
console.log(gfgVar)

// we can re-initializing the var multiple time


let proLan = "javascrip";
console.log(proLan);

let text;
text = "hello umesha";
console.log(text);

let first = "umesha";
//let first = "umesha";
//re re-initializin the left it not posiable 


//const  is used to store consonent value
const pi = "3.14";

// the re-declering the const is not posiable
// pi = "3.143";
// console.log(pi);
//it will rise an error in the run time 


//const pi = "3.14";
//redeclering also not posiable for const 

//const pi; this is also rise an error \
//pi = 3.14;
// because the declering and assign the const at the same time
// not poosiable when declering the const and the intialisin it not posiable
