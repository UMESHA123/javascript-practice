we know that when the javascript is executed in two step 
and this execution is happen in class stack.

class stack is nothing but an  call memory .

when the global executtion is created at that time it is pushed to the stack.
if any function excution context are present then those context are also pushed into the 
stock in the order they are mensioned in the code 

for example : stack[globa;_exe_context,func_exe_con1,func_exe_con2.....]
pushing the obj to the class stack happing in creation pahseit first 
push the global execution context into the stack and then the func_exe_con1, func_exe_con2
and so on and in during the execution phase the last pushed func_exe_con2 is poped and 
complier will first execute that first and after compliteing the that context.
the next obj is poped from the class and execute that and this process is continous
 
 stack[globa_exe_context,func_exe_con1,func_exe_con2.....] executing  fun..
stack[globa_exe_context,func_exe_con1,func_exe_con2] executing func_exe_con2
stack[globa_exe_context,func_exe_con1] executing func_exe_con1
stack[globa_exe_context] executing globa_exe_context.
stack[] --> is stack became empty the excution is complited.
